# Privacy Policy

**Last Updated:** 31.01.2026

This Privacy Policy explains how the **LeaseWithEase** application ("the App") handles your information. We are committed to protecting your privacy and ensuring you have full control over your data.

### 1. Information Collection and Use

The App does not automatically collect any personally identifiable information.

The only data the App handles is the information you actively and voluntarily enter (e.g., vehicle contract details, mileage readings, and dates). This data is used solely within the App to provide its core functionality, such as calculating and displaying your mileage status.

### 2. Data Storage

**Your data never leaves your device.** All information you enter into the App is stored strictly locally on your Android device's internal storage. We do not transmit, upload, sync, or back up your data to any external servers or third parties.

### 3. Data Retention and Deletion

Because your data is stored locally, you retain complete control over it. You can permanently delete all data stored by the App at any time through one of the following methods:

* By going to your Android device's system settings (e.g., *Settings > Apps > [App Name] > Storage > Clear Data*).
* By uninstalling the App from your device.

### 4. Data Sharing

We do not share, sell, or disclose any user data to third parties.

### 5. Changes to This Policy

We may update this Privacy Policy from time to time. You are advised to review this page periodically for any changes.

### 6. Contact Us

If you have any questions or suggestions about our Privacy Policy, do not hesitate to contact us at **lobe.development@gmail.com**.
